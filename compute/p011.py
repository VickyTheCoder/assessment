"""
Write a program to find the 3rd angle of a triangle if other two angles are given?

Run 1:
Enter first angle of the triangle(in degrees): 45
Enter second angle of the triangle(in degrees): 45
The third angle is 90 degrees

Run 2:
Enter first angle of the triangle(in degrees): 100
Enter second angle of the triangle(in degrees): 82
The third angle is -2 degrees

Run 3:
Enter first angle of the triangle(in degrees): -1
Enter second angle of the triangle(in degrees): -2
The third angle is 183 degrees

Note:
(100, 82) & (-1,-2) cases are invalid cases
but still compute without complaining!!

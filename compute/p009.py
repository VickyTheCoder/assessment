Write a program to find perimeter of a triangle?

Run 1:
Enter length of side1 in cms: 3
Enter length of side2 in cms: 3
Enter length of side3 in cms: 3
Perimter of the triangle is 9 cms

Run 2:
Enter length of side1 in cms: 3
Enter length of side2 in cms: 3
Enter length of side3 in cms: 10
Perimter of the triangle is 16 cms

Run 3:
Enter length of side1 in cms: 3
Enter length of side2 in cms: 3
Enter length of side3 in cms: 4
Perimter of the triangle is 10 cms

Note: 
3,3,10 is not a valid triangle but don't complain just compute it!!
